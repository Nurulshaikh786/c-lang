Q.1 What is the purpose of the 'printf()' function in C? Provide an example of its usage.
ans-The 'printf()' function in C is used to print formatted output to the standard output (usually the console). It allows you to display text along with variable values, formatted in various ways.

 Here's an example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}

Q.2 Explain the significance of escape sequence characters in C. Give examples of two commonly
used escape sequence characters.
ans-Escape sequence characters in C are special characters that are preceded by a backslash '\' and have special meanings. 
They are used to perform various tasks such as controlling cursor movement, inserting special characters, and formatting output. 
Two commonly used escape sequence characters are '\n' for a newline and '\t' for a tab


Q.3 Describe the role of the '\n' escape sequence character in C. How does it affect the output of a
program?
ans- The '\n' escape sequence character in C is used to insert a newline character into the output stream. When encountered in a string within a 'printf()'
statement, it moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line. 

For example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello\nWorld!");
    return 0;
}

Output:
Hello
World!

Q.4 What is the function of the '\t' escape sequence character in C? Provide an example of its usage.
ans-The '\t; escape sequence character in C is used to insert a horizontal tab into the output stream. It moves the cursor to the next tab stop. 

Here's an example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Name:\tJohn\nAge:\t25");
    return 0;
}

Output:
Name:   John
Age:    25


Q.5 How can you print a backslash character '\' using the 'printf()' function in C?
ans-To print a backslash character '\' using the 'printf()' function in C, you need to escape it by using '\\'. 

For example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("This is a backslash: \\");
    return 0;
}


Q.6 Explain the concept of a basic C program. Provide a simple example of a C program with its
components.
ans-A basic C program typically consists of a few components:

Preprocessor Directives: These are lines that start with #. They are instructions to the compiler to include certain header files or perform certain actions before compilation.
Main Function: The 'main()[ function is the entry point of a C program where execution begins.
Statements and Expressions: These are the actual instructions that the program will execute.
Return Statement: The return statement is used to return a value from the 'main()' function.

Example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}




Q.7 Discuss the importance of the 'main()' function in a C program. What is its significance?
ans- The 'main()' function in a C program serves as the entry point for program execution. It's where the program begins its execution.
 The 'main()' function must be present in every C program, and the program starts executing from the first statement inside the 'main()' function.




Q.8 How do you include comments in a C program? Why are comments useful in programming?
ans-Comments in a C program are used to provide explanations or annotations within the code. They are ignored by the compiler and are purely for human understanding. Comments can be added using '//' for single-line comments or'/* */' for multi-line comments. 
They are useful for documenting code, explaining complex parts, or temporarily excluding code from execution.

Example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // This is a single-line comment
    printf("Hello, World!"); // This prints "Hello, World!"
    /* 
       This is a multi-line comment.
       It spans multiple lines.
    */
    return 0;
}




Q.9 What is the purpose of the '#include <stdio.h>' and '#include <conio.h>' directives in a C program?
Explain its significance.
ans-The '/#include <stdio.h>' directive is used to include the standard input-output library in a C program. It provides functions like 'printf()' and 'scanf()' for input and output operations. 
The '#include <conio.h>' directive is used for console input-output operations in older versions of C and is not a part of the standard C library.


Q.10 Write a simple C program that demonstrates the use of 'printf()' to display “Hello, World!”
followed by a new line.
ans-Here's a simple C program that demonstrates the use of printf() to display "Hello, World!" followed by a new line:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
